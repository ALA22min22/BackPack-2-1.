    <h2>React Lifecycle (6 Questions)</h2>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q1: What is the React component lifecycle?</strong>
        <p>A React lifecycle is the series of phases a component goes through, such as mounting, updating, and
            unmounting.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q2: What happens in the mounting phase?</strong>
        <p>In the mounting phase, the component is created and inserted into the DOM for the first time.
            During this phase, initial rendering happens and setup tasks can be performed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q3: What is componentDidMount used for?</strong>
        <p>It is used to perform side effects like API calls after the component is rendered.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q4: What is the updating phase?</strong>
        <p>The updating phase occurs when props or state change and the component re-renders.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q5: What is componentWillUnmount?</strong>
        <p>It is called before a component is removed from the DOM and is used for cleanup.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q6: How are lifecycle methods handled in functional components?</strong>
        <p>They are handled using the useEffect hook instead of class-based lifecycle methods.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Routing -->
    <h2>Routing (6 Questions)</h2>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q7: What is routing in React?</strong>
        <p>Routing allows navigation between different pages or components without reloading the page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q8: Which library is commonly used for routing?</strong>
        <p>React Router is the most commonly used library for routing in React applications.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q9: What is BrowserRouter?</strong>
        <p>BrowserRouter uses the browser history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q10: What is the Route component?</strong>
        <p>Route is used to render a component when the URL path matches a specific route.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q11: What is Link used for?</strong>
        <p>Link is used to navigate between routes without reloading the page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q12: What is protected routing?</strong>
        <p>Protected routing restricts access to certain routes based on authentication status.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- State Management -->
    <h2>State Management (6 Questions)</h2>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q13: What is state in React?</strong>
        <p>State is an object that stores dynamic data and controls component behavior.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q14: Difference between state and props?</strong>
        <p>State is managed inside the component, while props are passed from parent to child.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <strong>Q15: How do you update state?</strong>
        <p>State is updated using the setState method or state updater functions.</p>

        <strong>Q17: What is useState hook?</strong>
        <p>useState is a hook that allows functional components to manage state.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
